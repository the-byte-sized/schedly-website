# Creating Events

Events in GoSchedule are designed to adapt to diverse scheduling needs, from individual appointments to large-scale bookings. 

By leveraging rules for validation, conflict resolution, and external integrations, GoSchedule ensures reliable and flexible event management.

*Its a good idea to have familiarised yourself with GoSchedules definition of a rule before reading this article.*

## Introduction

## Why add events via the API?

GoSchedule can be used without your users even knowing, as resource creation and provisioning can be done 100% through the API.

As such this tutorial will focus on resource creation solely through the API.

<Alert icon={false} severity="info">
  <AlertTitle>{'ðŸ“˜ Using the Admin Dashboard'}</AlertTitle>
  You don't have to use the API to create new users.

  Visit your Admin Dashboard and navigate to your resource page for the option to create a new resource with a few clicks.
</Alert>

## Examples

As per REST conventions you create resources by requesting the /resource endpoint with a POST.

### Create a New Event

This example schedules an event for a haircut.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/events" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "entityId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "title": "Haircut Appointment",
  "startAt": "2024-12-02T09:00:00.000Z",
  "endAt": "2024-12-02T09:30:00.000Z",
  "metadata": {
    "client": "John Doe",
    "notes": "Prefers short sides"
  }
}'
```

The above request will produce a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "id": "event-id",
  "entityId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "title": "Haircut Appointment",
  "startAt": "2024-12-02T09:00:00.000Z",
  "endAt": "2024-12-02T09:30:00.000Z",
  "metadata": {
    "client": "John Doe",
    "notes": "Prefers short sides"
  },
  "createdAt": "2023-11-27T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Retrieve Events by Date

This example retrieves events for a specific entity on a specific date (e.g., December 2, 2024).

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/entities/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/events?date=2024-12-02"
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": "event-id-1",
    "entityId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "title": "Haircut Appointment",
    "startAt": "2024-12-02T09:00:00.000Z",
    "endAt": "2024-12-02T09:30:00.000Z",
    "metadata": {
      "client": "John Doe",
      "notes": "Prefers short sides"
    }
  }
]
```
