# Working with our API

The tutorials on these pages assume that you have at least a basic understanding of what a RESTful API is.

## Getting Started

### Sign Up and Create an App

First of all, you need to **sign up** before you can start consuming the API. You can sign up [here](https://admin.ZenSched.io/login).  
You also need to create a **ZenSched app**, as all requests to the API are made in the context of an app.

---

## Tools and Standards

### cURL

All code examples use the **cURL command line tool**, which is a simple and common tool for communicating via HTTP and perfect for consuming RESTful APIs. We've tried our best to make the code examples copy-pastable, so you should basically just replace IDs if you're taking these tutorials for a spin.

### JSON

ZenSched uses **JSON** as its data format, so all data to and from ZenSched must be and will be formatted in JSON.  
You need to set an HTTP header like this:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

All our cURL examples include this header for your convenience.

### RFC3339 Timestamps

The standard timestamp format we use is **RFC3339**, which is a subset of ISO8601 but more narrowly defined and precise. Some programming languages may lack an RFC3339-specific format but will often have an ISO8601 format that is RFC3339 compatible.  

An RFC3339 timestamp will look like this:  
`2017-11-24T08:46:01+02:00`

## Authentication

We use **Basic Authentication** over HTTPS.

### App API-Key Authentication

App API-Key authentication is slightly different from traditional basic authentication. There is no email or username value associated with the App API-Key, so the authentication only uses the key value as the password. For example:

#### cURL Example:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.zensched.io/v2/bookings \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \   
  --user :live_api_key_7nzvc7wsBQQISLeFSVhROys9V1bUJ1z7
```

Notice that there is a prefixing colon on the key value. That cURL example will respond with all the bookings for the app identified by the App API-Key.

You can find your App API-Key in the admin under **API settings**.
