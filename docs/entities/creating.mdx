# Creating Entities

Entities can represent people (employees, vendors), items (screwdriver, musical instrument) or locations (meeting rooms).

*Its a good idea to have familiarised yourself with ZenScheds definition of a bookable entites before reading this article.*

## Introduction 

### Why add entities via the API?

ZenSched can be used without your users even knowing, as resource creation and provisioning can be done 100% through the API. 

As such this tutorial will focus on resource creation solely through the API.

  <AlertTitle>{'ðŸ“˜ Using the Admin Dashboard'}</AlertTitle>
    You don't have to use the API to create new users. 
    
    Visit your Admin Dashboard and navigate to your resource page for the option to create a new resource with a few clicks.

### Save the IDs

As we'll demonstrate further down each resource will have its own unique identifier in the form of a UUID. This UUID is all you need to get up and running, querying for availability and handle bookings.

As per REST conventions you create resources by requesting the /resource endpoint with a POST like so:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.zensched.io/v1/entities \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --user :live_api_key_7nzvc7wsBQQISLeFSVhROys9V1bUJ1z7 \
  --data '{
    "email": "doc.brown@zensched.io",
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "name": "Doc Brown",
    "password": "FluxCapacitator"
  }'
```

This will create the Doc Brown resource, only the "name" and "timezone" parameters are mandatory, email is not mandatory as its not common for a conference room to have an email address, just to exemplify what a resource could also be.

The above request will produce a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "78a4d873-2a68-41c6-bdd4-c0ca5b35efd3",
    "first_name": "Doc Brown",
    "last_name": "",
    "name": "Doc Brown",
    "email": "doc.brown@zensched.io",
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "calendars": [
      "id": "bfa0b9fa-36aa-4ae6-8096-f3b20fbed1d2"

}
```
