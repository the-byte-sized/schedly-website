# Entities Overview

In ZenSched, entities are the core building blocks used to model the scheduling and availability management system. Each entity serves as an abstract and flexible component that can represent various roles and functions, making ZenSched adaptable to a wide range of use cases.

## Key Characteristics of Entities

	### Types of Entities
		-	**Resource:** Represents tangible or intangible resources that can be scheduled, such as a barber, a meeting room, or a piece of equipment.
		-	**Service:** Represents activities or offerings that can be scheduled, such as a haircut, a workshop, or a medical consultation.
	
	### Hierarchy
		-	Entities can have parent-child relationships. For instance, a “Barber” (entity) can have child services like “Haircut” or “Beard Trim.”
		-	This hierarchical structure allows the system to dynamically aggregate and manage availability rules across related entities.
	
	## Metadata
		-	Each entity has a customizable metadata field (JSON) to store additional information like service duration, pricing, or other context-specific details.
	
	## Scheduling Rules
		-	Entities can have business rules (whitelist) defining when they are available and exceptions (blacklist) specifying periods of unavailability.
		-	These rules can be recurring (e.g., every Monday from 9 AM to 5 PM) or specific to a particular date (e.g., closed on December 25th).
	
	## Integration
		-	Entities can act as a Data Source, integrating with external systems like Google Calendar or Outlook. This allows events and availability to synchronize seamlessly between ZenSched and external platforms.

## The Role of Entities in Scheduling

Entities form the foundation for:
-	**Defining availability:** By applying scheduling rules like business hours, closing hours, and exceptions.
-	**Managing events:** Storing and retrieving scheduled events like appointments or bookings.
-	**Handling conflicts:** Validating time slots by reconciling rules, exceptions, and existing events.
-	**Customization:** Allowing metadata and hierarchical relationships to create dynamic, domain-specific scheduling logic.

By combining these capabilities, ZenSched's entities empower users to build a robust and customizable scheduling system that fits their unique needs while maintaining high flexibility and efficiency.
