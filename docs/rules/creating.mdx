# Creating Rules

Rules in ZenSched serve as the backbone for managing availability and restrictions.

By combining whitelist and blacklist rules, recurrence, and hierarchical inheritance, the system provides a robust and flexible mechanism to handle any scheduling scenario, from simple business hours to complex exceptions and custom requirements.

*Its a good idea to have familiarised yourself with ZenScheds definition of a rule before reading this article.*

## Introduction

## Why add entities via the API?

ZenSched can be used without your users even knowing, as resource creation and provisioning can be done 100% through the API.

As such this tutorial will focus on resource creation solely through the API.

<Alert icon={false} severity="info">
  <AlertTitle>{'ðŸ“˜ Using the Admin Dashboard'}</AlertTitle>
  You don't have to use the API to create new users.

  Visit your Admin Dashboard and navigate to your resource page for the option to create a new resource with a few clicks.

## Examples

As per REST conventions you create resources by requesting the /resource endpoint with a POST.

### Create a Recurring Rule (Business Hours)

This example creates a whitelist rule indicating that an entity is available every Monday and Friday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/rules" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"entityId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
"type": "WHITELIST",
"isRecurring": true,
"rule": {
"days": ["monday", "friday"],
"timeRanges": [
{ "start": "09:00", "end": "17:00" }
]
},
"startAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
"endAt": "2024-12-31T23:59:59.000Z"
}'
```

This will create the rules for the entity with id *123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000*.

The above request will produce a response similar to this:

```json
{
"id": "rule-id",
"entityId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
"type": "WHITELIST",
"isRecurring": true,
"rule": {
"days": ["monday", "friday"],
"timeRanges": [
{ "start": "09:00", "end": "17:00" }
]
},
"startAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
"endAt": "2024-12-31T23:59:59.000Z",
"createdAt": "2023-11-27T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Create a One-Time Exception (Holiday Closure)

This example creates a blacklist rule for a specific date to block all availability on December 25, 2024.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/rules" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"entityId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
"type": "BLACKLIST",
"isRecurring": false,
"rule": {
"date": "2024-12-25",
"timeRanges": [
{ "start": "00:00", "end": "23:59" }
]
}
}'
```

The above request will produce a response similar to this:

```json
{
"id": "rule-id",
"entityId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
"type": "BLACKLIST",
"isRecurring": false,
"rule": {
"date": "2024-12-25",
"timeRanges": [
{ "start": "00:00", "end": "23:59" }
]
},
"createdAt": "2023-11-27T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```
