# Rules Overview

In GoSchedule, rules are a pivotal mechanism that govern the availability and behavior of entities. They provide a flexible and powerful framework to manage scheduling constraints, define operational periods, and handle exceptions. 

Rules ensure that the system adapts to a wide range of real-world scenarios, maintaining precision and consistency in scheduling.

## Key Characteristics of Rules
	### Types of Rules
		
	#### Whitelist Rules

	Specify allowed periods when an entity is available. These define “business hours” or other operational windows.

	#### Blacklist Rules
	
	Define restricted periods when an entity is unavailable. These account for holidays, maintenance, or other exceptions.

	### Recurrence
		-	Rules can be recurring (e.g., every Monday from 9 AM to 5 PM) or one-time (e.g., closed on December 25th).
		-	Recurrence supports patterns like specific days of the week or monthly schedules.
	
	### Time Ranges
		-	Each rule can include multiple time ranges (e.g., 9 AM–12 PM and 1 PM–5 PM), allowing granular control over availability within a day.
	
	###	Scope
		-	Rules apply to specific entities and can cascade within a hierarchy. For instance, a rule applied to a parent entity can influence its child entities unless overridden locally.
	
	###	Dynamic Behavior
		-	Rules are evaluated dynamically against other constraints like existing events, resource conflicts, and overlapping schedules.
	
	### Priority
		-	Blacklist Rules take precedence over Whitelist Rules. This ensures that exceptions like holidays or maintenance blocks always supersede general availability.

## How Rules Work in GoSchedule

	### Defining Availability
		
	Use Whitelist Rules to specify when an entity is available for scheduling. For example, define operating hours for a business or the availability of a service.

	### Handling Exceptions
	
	Use Blacklist Rules to handle periods when availability is restricted. For example, block time for maintenance, holidays, or staff meetings.

	### Dynamic Evaluation

	Rules are dynamically applied in conjunction with existing events and other constraints. This ensures that all time slots adhere to the defined rules and prevent scheduling conflicts.

	### Interaction with Entities

	Rules can be applied to specific entities or inherited by child entities, allowing flexible configurations that adapt to hierarchical structures.

	### Conflict Resolution

	When a time slot overlaps with both whitelist and blacklist rules, the Blacklist Rule takes precedence to ensure restricted periods are respected.
